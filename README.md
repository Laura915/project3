## Overview
​
This application was designed to allow users to meet others online by comparing their lists of Netflix top picks
​
## User Story

​AS A user

​I WANT to match with individuals who share my taste in television and film

​SO THAT I can meet potential life partners or friends

## Acceptance Criteria

​GIVEN that I want to go on a virtual date

​WHEN I create a profile

​THEN I am able to edit a profile picture, my gender and partner preference, and a list of favorite movies and series from Netflix

​WHEN I create my list of movies and TV series 

​THEN I am presented with people who made the same selections 

​WHEN I scroll down the page

​THEN I find rows of potential people to date

​WHEN I click on a person’s profile

​THEN I am presented with the option to schedule a date

​WHEN I select a person

​THEN their profiles are appended to my queue 

## Development
​
This is a MERN application. We used ReactJS, Node and Express Web Server. The back end was created with MongoDB and Atlas. This application uses both GET and POST routes. This application involves authentication of users. AmorFlix was deployed using Heroku.
​
## Future Development
​
We would like to add functionality that would allow our users to communicate through direct messaging.
